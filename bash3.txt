efficiency = tight coupling 
resilience = loose coupling 
goal build up utilities to couple to geometry and material

Geometry
radiance utility of sky dome matrix w/ some subdividision (spherical)
dome utility map avg matrix -> wind/temp/ground/solar flux
graph utility of matplot lib 0 - 2pi (360), rate of flux
graph utility of heatmap 0 - 2pi (36), rate of flux, by day
polar utility circle to square abstraction based on rate
projection utility of cosine-weighted rays to a geometry inside
transformation utility of subdivided mesh surface
transf utility of straight skeleton
transf utility of floor slices
projection utlity: epw spherical flux projected to surface
projection utility: epw spherical flux multiplied by area

Passive Energy
epw utility matrix of: dry bulb, dewpoint, RH, udir, ustar, GHR, DNR
heatmap utllity of data matrix by time
passive strategy from balance temp and epw 
schedule matrix -> mixed-mode schedule -> heatmap
Active Energy
latent and sensible heat loads from outdoor temp and balance temperature
vent/infil -> passive + recirculation for active energy 
benchmark/DOE utilitity of data for all other loads/schedules
object utility of systems with schedule
Renewable Energy
photovoltaic surface area utility
geothermal ground mass utility
Analysis
benchmark utilitity of data for outputs

Bem Obj
object utility for class of zone, subidivided facade
object utility construction, material assembly
object utility add zone data from openstudio(?) or bem(?) for balance temperature
object utility add HVAC system to each building w/ efficiencies, and peak load
use schedule from epw matrix to feed equipment loads
simulation utility = energy calculation from loads
