HEATMAP_GTD

X//EPW_UTILITY*
X- in epw
X- take bash epw and remove uwg simulation
X- use joseph's epw script to get data according to months
X- add uwg option
X- sort by month
X- output: numpy matrix of epw data by month

X//HEATMAP_UTILITY*
X- read up on numpy/matplotlib dependency
X- take numpy matrix and make heatmap

//NUMPY_CONDITIONS_MATRIX
- matrix of external conditions matrix
- matrix multiplication of conditions=conditions we must account for
- output = conditions matrix

//NUMPY_COMFORT_MATRIX*
- take inputs and calculate comfort
- get comfort formula
- output = numpy matrix
- add heatmap_utlity

//NUMPY_OCCUPANCY_MATRIX*
- make schedule matrix for four types (sin curve)
- make schedule matrix for equipment types (sin curve)
- bounds are 0 - 1

//EQUIPMENTS_LOAD_VECTOR
- one for each schedule vector
- make up some sin curves

//DIFFERENTIAL_FUNCTION
- this can be recorded as latex function
- just one
- output run diff fx for each type = db
- use element/material object to account for material properties

//STRATEGY_MATRIX
- add internal heat gains comfort matrix
- add no shading utility
- add no passive solar heat utility
- add fan utlity
- add evaporative cooling

//MAKE_HEATMAP*
- off all
- add labels
- as Megagrid
- add to powerpoint

//NEXT_STEPS
- draw geometry of box
- get solar flux on each mesh patch (UWG)
- add update solar flux addition to the model
- (additional update: use radiance for flux calc)

- radiance point to calculate view factor from inside
- radiance point to calculate view factor from inside
- calculate perimeter/core zones 
- generate new simplified zones
- serialize zones/surfaces for OpenStudio
- serialize zones for DF? - i.e vector of VF, area-weighted zones 
- open in BIM2BEM then ->
- bonus: all these spatial parameters can be dockerized and run as services from BIM2BEM 

- bonus: all this is useful stuff that can be added to BIM2BEM

- serialize percentile view (heads up)
- KISS -> tune the shape transformations: insert more granular data
- KISS -> tune the HVAC system via templates
