Today I tried to work out what “projecting” solar heat flux from a angled wedge onto a flat plane for dragonfly (as I suggested to Chris) would entail. 

Essentially: 

Qtotal_wedge => q_solar * |wedge_vector|

So to derive Qtotal_flat from Qtotal_wedge (which we simulated):

|flat_vector| => cos(theta) * |wedge_vector|  
So (I’m pretty sure this is right):
Qtotal_flat    => cos(theta) * q_solar

So SHGF is:
SHGF = (Qtotal_wedge / Qtotal_flat)
Qtotal_wedge = SHGF * Qtotal_flat

 SHGF = (Qtotal_wedge * (cos(theta) * q_solar)^-1)
