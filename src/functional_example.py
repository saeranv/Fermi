#https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html
Functional programming decomposes a problem into a set of functions.
Ideally, functions only take inputs and produce outputs, and donâ€™t have any
internal state that affects the output produced for a given input.
Well-known functional languages include the ML family (Standard ML, OCaml,
and other variants) and Haskell.
