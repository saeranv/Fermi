
Qtotal_wedge => q_solar * |wedge_vector|

So to derive Qtotal_flat from Qtotal_wedge (which we simulated):

|flat_vector| => cos(theta) * |wedge_vector|  
So (Iâ€™m pretty sure this is right):
Qtotal_flat    => cos(theta) * Qtotal_wedge

So SHGF is:
SHGF = (Qtotal_wedge / Qtotal_flat)
Qtotal_wedge = SHGF * Qtotal_flat

SHGF = (Qtotal_wedge * (cos(theta) * Qtotal_wedge)^-1)

So in essensce, all that SHGC calculation is simply projecting the Qtotal
